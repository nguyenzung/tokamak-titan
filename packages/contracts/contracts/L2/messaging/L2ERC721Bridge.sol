 *         make it possible to transfer ERC721 tokens from Ethereum to Optimism. This contract
 *         acts as a minter for new tokens when it hears about deposits into the L1 ERC721 bridge.
 *         This contract also acts as a burner for tokens being withdrawn.
 *         **WARNING**: Do not bridge an ERC721 that was originally deployed on Optimism. This
 *         bridge ONLY supports ERC721s originally deployed on Ethereum. Users will need to
 *         wait for the one-week challenge period to elapse before their Optimism-native NFT
 *         can be refunded on L2.
