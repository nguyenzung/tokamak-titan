# ERC721Bridge



> ERC721Bridge

ERC721Bridge is a base contract for the L1 and L2 ERC721 bridges.



## Methods

### bridgeERC721

```solidity
function bridgeERC721(address _localToken, address _remoteToken, uint256 _tokenId, uint32 _minGasLimit, bytes _extraData) external nonpayable
```

Initiates a bridge of an NFT to the caller&#39;s account on the other chain. Note that         this function can only be called by EOAs. Smart contract wallets should use the         `bridgeERC721To` function after ensuring that the recipient address on the remote         chain exists. Also note that the current owner of the token on this chain must         approve this contract to operate the NFT before it can be bridged.         **WARNING**: Do not bridge an ERC721 that was originally deployed on Optimism. This         bridge only supports ERC721s originally deployed on Ethereum. Users will need to         wait for the one-week challenge period to elapse before their Optimism-native NFT         can be refunded on L2.



#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _localToken | address | Address of the ERC721 on this domain.
| _remoteToken | address | Address of the ERC721 on the remote domain.
| _tokenId | uint256 | Token ID to bridge.
| _minGasLimit | uint32 | Minimum gas limit for the bridge message on the other domain.
| _extraData | bytes | Optional data to forward to the other chain. Data supplied here will not                     be used to execute any code on the other chain and is only emitted as                     extra data for the convenience of off-chain tooling.

### bridgeERC721To

```solidity
function bridgeERC721To(address _localToken, address _remoteToken, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, uint32 _minGasLimit, bytes _extraData) external nonpayable
```

Initiates a bridge of an NFT to some recipient&#39;s account on the other chain. Note         that the current owner of the token on this chain must approve this contract to         operate the NFT before it can be bridged.         **WARNING**: Do not bridge an ERC721 that was originally deployed on Optimism. This         bridge only supports ERC721s originally deployed on Ethereum. Users will need to         wait for the one-week challenge period to elapse before their Optimism-native NFT         can be refunded on L2.



#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _localToken | address | Address of the ERC721 on this domain.
| _remoteToken | address | Address of the ERC721 on the remote domain.
| _to | address | Address to receive the token on the other domain.
| _tokenId | uint256 | Token ID to bridge.
| _minGasLimit | uint32 | Minimum gas limit for the bridge message on the other domain.
| _extraData | bytes | Optional data to forward to the other chain. Data supplied here will not                     be used to execute any code on the other chain and is only emitted as                     extra data for the convenience of off-chain tooling.

### messenger

```solidity
function messenger() external view returns (contract CrossDomainMessenger)
```

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |

### otherBridge

```solidity
function otherBridge() external view returns (address)
```

Address of the bridge on the other network.




#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | address | undefined



## Events

### ERC721BridgeFinalized

```solidity
event ERC721BridgeFinalized(address indexed localToken, address indexed remoteToken, address indexed from, address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes extraData)
```

Emitted when an ERC721 bridge from the other network is finalized.



#### Parameters
